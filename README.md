# The Resume of Sam Turcotte

Personal Resume, always in-progress. I feel like this version of the idea is finally fully-formed enough to really get started.

## Getting Started

The project is very basic, and the only dependency is jQuery, which is accessed through a CDN. This could change in the future if I decide to add some animation libraries etc., but for now all you need is a Javascript-enabled browser to view the project. Just Fork or download the repo and open index.htl.

## Deployment

This site is currently deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can follow the instructions here to get started, then copy this repo and start changing the content to your own stuff.

## Built With

- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

- [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)

## Contributing | Using

Anyone is welcome to use this codebase as a starting point for their own personal resume. If you want to acknowledge me for the original idea or inspiration in the footer, that would be cool!

If you want to collaborate on a version, or just share some ideas, feel free to message me through Github or LinkedIn.
